Address Manager application is used to manage the different versions of address.

I have used Postman application for both input and output the result in the JSON format.

Created a rails project for managing the address version controller.

Address version controller is nothing but when ever there a client wants to change the address. A new version will be created. Suppose If a client wants the old address, this can be done by switching to the previous version. It is easy to change the address from the version table instead of creating a new one.


Controller : address, version
Model : address, version
DB Table : addresses, versions
